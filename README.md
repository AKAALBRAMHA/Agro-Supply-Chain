# FoodChain Smart Contract

## Project Description

The `foodchain` smart contract is designed to manage and track the lifecycle of products within a supply chain on a blockchain. It ensures transparency, traceability, and security by defining specific roles and allowing only authorized users to perform actions related to product management. 

This smart contract facilitates the coordination of various stakeholders involved in the supply chain, including producers, exporters, importers, manufacturers, transportation agencies, warehouses, inspection agencies, insurance companies, standards organizations, port authorities, customs authorities, and consumers. Each stakeholder has designated roles and responsibilities, ensuring that the supply chain operates smoothly and efficiently.

Key features of the `foodchain` smart contract include:

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Users must register with specific roles to access corresponding functions. This ensures that only authorized individuals can perform actions such as registering products, logging lifecycle events, and accessing product information.

- **Product Registration:** Authorized users can register new products on the blockchain, providing essential details such as product ID, name, weight, price, and sub-products. This creates a permanent record of each product's attributes and origin.

- **Lifecycle Event Logging:** Various lifecycle events, including harvesting, manufacturing, transportation, inspection, insurance, standardization, and customs clearance, are logged as events on the blockchain. This creates an immutable audit trail of the product's journey from its creation to its consumption.

- **Transparency and Traceability:** By recording each action on the blockchain, the `foodchain` smart contract ensures transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain. Consumers can verify the authenticity and provenance of products, promoting trust and accountability.

- **Immutable Record Keeping:** The blockchain's immutable nature ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or tampered with. This provides a secure and reliable record of the entire supply chain history.

- **Efficient Coordination:** By automating and streamlining supply chain processes, the `foodchain` smart contract facilitates efficient coordination among stakeholders. This reduces paperwork, minimizes delays, and enhances overall supply chain management.

Overall, the `foodchain` smart contract revolutionizes traditional supply chain management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and secure ecosystem for managing and tracking products from production to consumption.
